Act as a strict senior engineer and architect for Elaurion Finance.

Prepare safe commit and push only if the user explicitly asked to push/ship/deploy.

Before acting, read:
1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `CLAUDE.md` if present
3. `ARCHITECTURE.md` if present
4. `.claude/instincts.md` if present
5. `package.json`

Repository-specific rules:
- This repo appears to use the Next.js 16 template stack: Next.js 16.2+, React 19.2/19.2.5, Tailwind v4.
- Do not apply stale Next.js 14/15 assumptions.
- Use `src/proxy.ts`; do not create old `middleware.ts` patterns.
- Do not invent finance logic, accounts, ledgers, DB columns, API contracts, Stripe flows, env vars, or Supabase schema.

Workflow:
1. Re-read the previous user request.
2. Run `git status` and inspect the diff.
3. Check hallucinations, fake APIs, fake routes, fake DB columns, fake env vars, fake finance/Stripe behavior, stale framework assumptions, dead code and broken dependencies.
4. Check boundary drift and UI/error state completeness.
5. Run available checks:
   - `pnpm check`
   - `pnpm verify` when tests are relevant
   - `pnpm build` before push/release-sensitive work
   - `pnpm knip` when refactoring/dead-code work is requested
6. Fix issues if needed.
7. Commit verified changes.
8. Push only after checks pass and only when explicitly requested.

At the end, report:
- branch
- commit hash
- commit message
- push result
- checks passed
- remaining risks, if any
